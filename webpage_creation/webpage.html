      House Republicans Scramble to Save Ukrainian Aid as Border Policy Overhaul
      Stalls"
    </h2>
    <p>
      This article discusses the efforts being made by House Republicans to
      secure enough support for a standalone aid bill specifically focused on
      providing weapons and defensive funding for Ukraine. As discussions over
      funding for Kyiv and potential overhauls to U.S. border policies stall,
      Republican lawmakers are advocating for a compromise that would address
      the immediate needs of Ukraine. However, the bipartisan Senate deal that
      includes funding for Ukraine appears to be in danger of falling through,
      with growing doubts about its passing and its negative impact on GOP
      support. Additionally, concerns over corruption and accountability have
      led some lawmakers to call for a narrower, targeted aid bill for Ukraine.
      The article also highlights the potential consequences of failing to help
      Ukraine, as well as the ongoing negotiations and discussions surrounding
      the aid package.

      Trump Administration Suppressed Evidence of National Guard Offer on
      January 6th"
    </h2>
    <p>
      A recently revealed "hidden transcript" detailing an interview with former
      White House Deputy Chief of Staff Anthony Ornato shows that the
      congressional committee investigating January 6th allegedly withheld
      critical witness testimony. This evidence supports former President
      Trump's claims that he offered 10,000 National Guard troops to protect the
      Capitol, despite reports stating otherwise. The transcript also reveals
      potential communication between the White House and DC Mayor Muriel
      Bowser, as well as discussions about crowd sizes and the request for a
      "quick reaction force" at Joint Base Andrews. The committee's final report
      concluded that Trump never gave any order to deploy the National Guard,
      but this newly released transcript contradicts that statement.
