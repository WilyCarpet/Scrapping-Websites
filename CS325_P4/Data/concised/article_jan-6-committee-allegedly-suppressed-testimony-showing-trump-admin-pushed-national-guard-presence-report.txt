Trump Administration Suppressed Evidence of National Guard Offer on January 6th" 
A recently revealed "hidden transcript" detailing an interview with former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Anthony Ornato shows that the congressional committee investigating January 6th allegedly withheld critical witness testimony. This evidence supports former President Trump's claims that he offered 10,000 National Guard troops to protect the Capitol, despite reports stating otherwise. The transcript also reveals potential communication between the White House and DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, as well as discussions about crowd sizes and the request for a "quick reaction force" at Joint Base Andrews. The committee's final report concluded that Trump never gave any order to deploy the National Guard, but this newly released transcript contradicts that statement.
